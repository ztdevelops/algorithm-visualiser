# Algorithm Visualiser by Yue Zheng Ting
Welcome to my algorithm visualiser! I started this project with the intention of reinforcing my own understanding
of how the implemented algorithms as well as to visually observe how they work. It is truly fascinating to see them
in action!

You can access the visualiser at https://ztdevelops.github.io/algorithm-visualiser/.
